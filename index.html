        <p>
                When the Enola Gay went on display in June 1995, visitors to
            the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum found a truncated
            airplane: only fifty-six feet of fuselage could be squeezed into
            the building. But more than wings and tail were missing. So was
            the exhibition that got sheared away after a campaign of
            vilification arguably without precedent in the annals of American
            museology.
        </p>    
        <p>
                In the summer of 1994, reports flaming through the mass
            media had denounced the impending show as a monstrous attempt to
            recast the history of the Second World War. A typical
            description, by the Washington Post's Eugene Meyer, called it "an
            anti-nuke morality play in which Americans were portrayed as
            ruthless racists hellbent on revenge for Pearl Harbor, with the
            Japanese as innocent, even noble victims fighting to defend their
            unique culture from 'Western imperialism.'" Editorials blasted
            "anti-American" curators and warned that "revisionists" had
            hijacked the museum to promulgate PC history.
        </p>    
        <p>
                Air Force veterans responded angrily. Here they were, amidst
            the festivities marking the 50th anniversary of the Normandy
            landings, ready to take their turn in the sequence of
            celebrations. Instead, said the media, youthful visitors to the
            Smithsonian would soon find their grandparents reviled as racists
            and war criminals.
        </p>
        <p>
                These assertions were based on a misconstruction of National
            Air and Space Museum (NASM) intentions, and a profound
            misrepresentation of what the curators actually wrote. Few of the
            angry vets ever read the proposed scripts -- not unreasonably,
            given that each of the eventual five was over 500 pages long and
            none was easily available. Neither had many of the pundits, most
            of whom relied on a series of articles by John T. Correll, editor
            of AIR FORCE Magazine.
        </p>
        <p>
                My review of the scripts and their fate suggests that most
            of Correll's charges were unwarranted, some outrageously so. I do
            not claim that NASM officials were fault free. There were indeed
            problems with their first draft -- though mostly these were
            errors of omission rather than commission -- and their handling
            of the crisis once it blew up left much to be desired. But by no
            means did they deserve the abuse heaped upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
                More than individual reputations are at stake here. The
            scrapping of the Enola Gay exhibition raises troubling questions
            about the future of public historical discourse in the United
            States. The successful campaign to muzzle the Smithsonian was a
            battle fought on the history front of America's ongoing culture
            war. This essay seeks to understand the event and to set it in
            its larger context.
        </p>
        <h2>First Draft</h2>
        <p>
                The initial script of "Crossroads: The End of World War II,
            The Atomic Bomb, and The Origins of the Cold War " (January 12,
            1994), had five parts, one per gallery, each consisting of
            proposed label copy and suggested artifacts.
        </p>
        <p>
                The first section ("A Fight to the Finish") dealt primarily
            with the final year of the war. The introductory segment asserted
            Japan's culpability for the sequence of events that led to the
            bomb. Recapitulating Japan's 1930s expansionism ("marked by naked
            aggression and extreme brutality"), it sketched the course of the
            war from Pearl Harbor on, mentioning Japanese atrocities, use of
            slave labor, racist attitudes, and maltreatment of prisoners of
            war ("often starved, beaten and tortured.") It then -- in a space
            dominated by a kamikaze aircraft looming overhead -- zeroed in on
            the fierce Japanese resistance at Iwo Jima and Okinawa, finding
            in it "a terrible warning of what could be expected in the
            future".
        </p>
        <p>
                The section did include two shortly to be infamous
            sentences: "For most Americans, this war was fundamentally
            different than the one waged against Germany and Italy -- it was
            a war of vengeance. For most Japanese, it was a war to defend
            their unique culture against Western imperialism."
        </p>
        <p>
                These were not great sentences -- not wrong, in context, but
            easily misrepresented. Americans were in a fury in 1945 -- and
            why shouldn't they have been, given Pearl Harbor, four years of
            ferocious war, and recently declassified accounts of the Bataan
            death march? Many were calling for revenge, some even for
            extermination. But this is not to say -- nor did the script --
            that the war, or the bomb, were only motivated by vengeance.
        </p>
        <p>
                Nor was it wrong to observe that the Japanese believed
            unconditional surrender would mean the end of the Emperor system
            and the collapse of their culture. Or that many Japanese -- then
            and to this day -- represented their racist exploitation of other
            Asians as a shield against western imperialism. The script didn't
            ratify this self-perception, it demonstrated it, as crucial to
            understanding the tenacity of Japanese resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
                But opponents wrenched the sentences out of context and used
            them to stoke outrage. Even after they were swiftly dropped, and
            the Smithsonian had explicitly and indignantly denied the
            construction put upon them, critics trotted them out again and
            again, in the absence of any other sentence that would so well
            serve their purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
                Correll also argued that this section did not represent the
            history of Japanese aggression graphically enough to offset the
            emotional impact of later material on the effects of the bombing.
            Counting up the number of photographs of suffering Americans and
            finding it lower than the number depicting suffering Japanese, he
            charged that a victimology thesis lay embedded in the structure
            of the exhibition.
        </p>
        <p>
                He was partly right about the effect, totally wrong about
            the intention. There was no plot to delete evidence of Japanese
            wickedness in order to manipulate visitors into finding Americans
            immoral. Any exhibition focused on the Enola Gay and its bombing
            run would, almost by definition, depict more Japanese than
            American casualties.
        <p>
                But curators did face a museological conundrum. Ground Zero
            artifacts and images, no matter how few their number, pack a
            wallop. So does the Enola Gay. Together they could overshadow
            almost anything in a merely introductory section. Designers at
            first resisted a "balance of corpses" approach -- giving, for
            example, equal space to the slaughter at Nanking, where more died
            than at Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- in part because they rejected
            the vengeance thesis which they were accused of promulgating. It
            was the critics, after all, who insisted that Hiroshima was
            justified not because of prior Japanese outrages -- though they
            had to be fed into the moral equation -- but as a military action
            taken to expeditiously end the war Japan had started.  The
            curators, moreover, were assuming that most visitors already knew
            something about Pearl Harbor and the war in the Pacific --
            subjects treated extensively in an adjacent NASM gallery. This
            was a mistake. For most young Americans, those events are as
            distant as the Punic Wars. The museum admitted its mistake. In
            succeeding drafts the curators would expand the initial section,
            adding dramatic material on Japanese outrages (though none would
            tackle the history of American expansionism in Asia, nor would
            any critic remark on this oversight). Finally the staff would
            design a 4,000 square foot prefatory exhibition on the war in the
            Pacific. Tellingly, the addition of this contextual material
            would fail to assuage the critics.
        </p>
        <p>
                Correll's passion for context stopped short when it came to
            the second section, an analysis, housed in one of the smaller
            galleries, of "The Decision to Drop the Bomb." Here the objection
            was to problematizing something deemed utterly unproblematic.
            Truman dropped the bomb to shorten the war and save lives,
            period. Raising questions about that decision, from the vantage
            point of "hindsight," was infuriating and illegitimate.
        </p>
        <p>
                But questions were raised at the time, and by the nation's
            preeminent civilian and military leaders. The endgame of World
            War II raised tactical and strategic issues of great political,
            moral and military complexity. The script reviewed some debates
            that arose among participants at the time, and later between
            historians, explicitly labeling them as "Controversies". Why did
            these explorations create such an uproar?
        </p>
        <p>
                One firestorm erupted over a hypothetical: if the U.S. had
            had to invade Japan to end the war, how many Americans would have
            died? The conventional popular wisdom on this subject is that
            perhaps half a million would have fallen. But this was a postwar
            judgement. In 1947, former Secretary of War Henry Stimson, intent
            on rebutting Hiroshima critics like John Hersey, claimed there
            would have been over a million American casualties. Truman later
            claimed a half million lives were at risk, a figure that
            Churchill doubled.
        </p>
        <p>
                The exhibit draft, for all that it was accused of employing
            hindsight, relied instead on wartime estimates by MacArthur,
            Marshall, and various Joint Chiefs of Staff planning committees,
            rather than using after-the-fact figures that even the American
            Legion admitted were "incredibly high". It concluded that it
            "appears likely that post-war estimates of a half million
            American deaths were too high, but many tens of thousands of dead
            were a real possibility."
        </p>
        <p>
                This enraged the critics. They claimed NASM had pruned the
            figure to render the bomb-drop immoral, as if only a gigantic
            quantity of saved lives could offset the enormous number of
            civilians actually killed. There is, one would hope, some
            statistic that might generate moral misgivings. Would saving 1000
            American soldiers -- 100 -- 10 -- justify killing 100,000
            civilians? But the script never raised such a question, never
            challenged the position that if an invasion had been the only
            alternative, the savings in lives would have justified the
            bombings.
        </p>
        <p>
                The tougher question -- which the script did ask -- is
            whether or not an invasion was necessary in the first place. Huge
            numbers of veterans believed that it was inevitable, and that
            dropping the bomb therefore saved their lives, and the lives of
            many Japanese as well. But were they right? The exhibit script
            offended some by recalling that powerful wartime figures believed
            it was possible to end the war without either nuclear bombings or
            an invasion.
        </p>
        <p>
                Leading military men insisted that the combination of
            blockade and conventional bombing had brought Japan to its knees.
            Top Navy admirals "believed that its blockade could force Japan
            to quit the war, while many Army Air Forces' generals thought
            firebombing could force surrender by itself or in conjunction
            with the blockade." The script also cited the U.S. Strategic
            Bombing Survey, conducted after the surrender, which said the war
            would "certainly" have ended before the end of 1945, probably
            before November 1.
        </p>
        <p>
                Label copy also took note of direct military opposition to
            nuclear weapons. The show quoted a statement made in 1950 by
            Admiral William D. Leahy, Truman's Chief of Staff, in which he
            denounced the bombing as adopting "ethical standards common to
            barbarians in the dark ages," but added cautiously that "1945
            documents only suggest that he was skeptical that the atomic bomb
            would ever work." It mentioned General Eisenhower's claims in
            1948 and later that he had opposed its use in conversations with
            Truman at Potsdam in 1945, but suggested that "corroborating
            evidence for these assertions is weak."##1 The script did not,
            however, engage the contemporary and postwar reservations of
            American airmen such as Henry H. ["Hap"] Arnold, the commanding
            general of the U.S. Army Air Forces, or Generals Carl Spaatz and
            Curtis LeMay.##2
        </p>
        <p>
                One "Historical Controversy" panel asked: "Would the War
            Have Ended Sooner if the United States Had Guaranteed the
            Emperor's Position?"  The text noted some scholars believe this.
            More to the point, Acting Secretary of State (and former
            Ambassador to Japan) Joseph Grew, Navy Secretary James Forrestal,
            Assistant Secretary for War John McCloy, General Douglas
            MacArthur, Admiral Leahy, Winston Churchill, and Herbert Hoover
            were among the many who thought that modifying the unconditional
            surrender formula to allow retention of the emperor would
            strengthen the peace faction, aid in winning and effectuating an
            early surrender, and facilitate the postwar occupation. Truman
            rejected this advice -- though after the bombs were dropped, that
            is precisely what was done.
        </p>
        <p>
                Some historians say Truman (counseled by Secretary of State
            James Byrnes) feared that modification would provoke vehement
            popular and congressional protest. Some even argue that by
            waiting until the A-bombs were ready in August the U.S. high
            command may have muffed an opportunity to end the war in June,
            thus costing American lives. The script, however, said no such
            thing. It stated instead that while "it is possible that there
            was a lost opportunity to end the war without either atomic
            bombings or an invasion of Japan," these alternatives were "more
            obvious in hindsight than they were at the time." Citing the
            counterargument -- that it took the shock of the bombs (and
            Russian intervention) to "give Hirohito a facesaving way to force
            a surrender on his hard-liners" -- and noting the impossibility
            of proving either case, the text concluded that this particular
            debate "will remain forever controversial."
        </p>
        <p>
                Another question: did Truman drop the bombs primarily to
            forestall Soviet creation of an Asian sphere of influence, and
            gain diplomatic leverage in the already emerging cold war? There
            are historians who argue this. The show did not. It said
            explicitly that "most scholars have rejected this argument,
            because they believe that Truman and his advisers saw the bomb
            first and foremost as a way to shorten the war." Concern about
            the Russians only "provided one more reason for Truman not to
            halt the dropping of the bomb."
        </p>
        <p>
                Was atom-bombing cities a violation of rules of war? There
            were strictures against attacking civilian populations;
            democracies had denounced fascists for violating these rules in
            Barcelona, Guernica, London and China; and reservations about
            bombing civilians were raised by Eisenhower, Leahy, and Marshall.
            But the show argues that for most Americans, the earlier moral
            constraints against killing civilians had already crumbled in the
            course of a savage war, and that most key decision makers "did
            not see [nuclear attacks] as being drastically different than
            conventional strategic bombing..."
        </p>
        <p>
                Was dropping the bomb racist? In Europe the U.S. Army Air
            Force stuck to precision attacks on military targets -- or at
            least professed to -- as late as the Dresden firebombing, when
            Marshall and Stimson publicly disavowed any policy of "terror
            bombing on civilian populations." Days later General LeMay
            napalmed Tokyo, launching an incendiary campaign that killed more
            civilians in five months than the Allies had in five years of
            bombing Germany. Some historians have argued that anti-Asian
            racism helps explain the difference in approach.
        </p>
        <p>
                The script, however, did not even raise the issue. It did
            note that most Americans considered their European enemies to be
            good people misled by evil leaders, while viewing Japanese as
            "treacherous and inhuman." The text traced this disparity in
            attitude to contemporary horror at Japanese atrocities and to
            longstanding anti-Asian racism. (The script also underscored
            Japanese racism, observing that "Allied people and leaders were
            pictured as inhuman demons, lice, insects, and vermin," and that
            "propaganda made frequent reference to the 'Jewish' nature of the
            Allied cause.") Nevertheless, the proposed label copy insisted
            that nuclear weapons would have been used against Germans had
            they been ready in time, thereby denying the charge of racial
            motivation.
        </p>
        <p>
                Should there have been a warning or a demonstration? The
            script mentioned the objections raised by scientists and
            officials like McCloy and Undersecretary of the Navy Ralph Bard.
            (It did not, oddly, mention the reservations expressed by General
            Marshall. In May 1945, Marshall said the bomb should be dropped
            only on a "straight military objective such as a large military
            installation," and then, if necessary, on a manufacturing center,
            but only after civilians had been warned so they could flee.) The
            text also laid out the "valid concerns that a warning could
            endanger Allied servicemen and that a demonstration might be
            ineffective or a failure" -- objections on which Truman relied.
            And it emphasized that Hiroshima at that time was still a
            military target -- all too readily, in the opinion of some
            historians.
        </p>
        <p>
                The important thing to note about this part of the
            exhibition is that, overall, it adequately and appropriately
            provided visitors with a sense of the complexities of the bombing
            decision and the controversies surrounding it. It is possible to
            quarrel with this or that formulation. The information could have
            been presented in greater depth, and more dramatically, perhaps
            by using videotapes of historians and participants. Some of the
            label copy could have been, and almost certainly would have been,
            formulated more cogently. It was, after all, a first draft; few
            writers would want their initial efforts subjected to such fierce
            and public scrutiny. But given those attacks, what's striking is
            the text's conformity with the findings of responsible
            scholarship, its moderate and balanced stance on the issues, and
            the fact that, in essence, it supported Truman's decision.
        </p>
        <p>
                Part III, "The World's First Atomic Strike Force," was
            planned for the cavernous arena where the giant plane was to be
            housed. Here the exhibition script presented the pilots' story
            "extensively and with respect," as Correll admitted on one
            occasion. Indeed the show emphasized the bravery and sacrifices
            of those who fought. But neither Correll nor anyone else ever
            again remarked on this vast mass of material, which so starkly
            contradicted claims that the NASM dishonored veterans. Nor was
            there ever any discussion of the quarter hour videotape the
            museum put together with crew members from the two bombers, a
            commemorative component which veterans who saw it loved.
        </p>
        <p>
                Critics seized instead on Part IV, "Cities at War," which
            looked at Hiroshima and Nagasaki's role in the Japanese military
            effort, and then depicted the nuclear devastation wrought upon
            them. Here visitors were to have moved into a somber space of
            giant blowups, powerful objects, and taped reminiscences of
            survivors. Correll decried not only the number but the nature of
            the artifacts included -- a lunchbox containing "carbonized
            remains of sweet green peas and polished rice," a fused rosary.
            But the stubborn facts are that high school girls were out in
            force on August 6 clearing rubble at what became Ground Zero, and
            that Nagasaki was the center of the Catholic community in Japan.
            It's possible that a more understated display may have been more
            effective, and aroused less ire, though opponents disliked even
            its later, toned-down version.
        </p>
        <p>
                Was the museum, as charged, angling for America to
            "apologize for its use of the atomic bomb to end World War II?"
            asked NASM Director Martin Harwit? "Of course not!" "Should we
            show compassion for those who perished on the ground? As human
            beings, I believe we must."
        </p>
        <p>
                The analysis of bomb damage, moreover, was intended to
            educate, not manipulate. Information about the split-second
            annihilation caused by the blast, the way 7200 degree fahrenheit
            heat vaporized people, and the short and long term effects of
            radiation, made clear the error of contemporary assumptions that
            nuclear bombs were merely bigger versions of conventional ones.
            Some critics argued there was no need for NASM to rehearse such
            gruesome information as it was already widely known. Alas, the
            latest Gallup Poll finds that one in four Americans don't even
            know an atomic bomb was dropped on Japan, much less what impact
            it had when it exploded.
        </p>
        <p>
                In the last gallery, a coda on "The Legacy of Hiroshima and
            Nagasaki" spoke to this educational vacuum. It treated the
            bombings as not simply the end of World War II but as "symbols of
            the arrival of the nuclear age, and as a glimpse of the realities
            of nuclear war." Although the exhibit could hardly do more than
            gesture at the complex history of the Cold War in the space
            allotted, it did at least raise some important issues.
        </p>
        <p>
                It offered an all-too-brief survey of the postwar nuclear
            arms race. It noted the invention of hydrogen bombs, a thousand
            times more powerful than their atomic predecessors. It mentioned
            the buildup of world stockpiles to 70,000 warheads by the mid-
            1980s. It sketched the emergence of antinuclear movements
            concerned about atomic-test fallout and radioactive wastes. It
            discussed the end of the cold war and the signing of arms control
            agreements. And it referred to the continuing dangers of nuclear
            proliferation and atomic terrorism. Its concluding panel stated:
            "Some feel that the only solution is to ban all nuclear weapons.
            Others think that this idea is unrealistic and that nuclear
            deterrence--at a much lower level--is the only way that major
            wars can be prevented."
        </p>
        <h2>Offense and Defense</h2>
        <p>
             The January 12th draft was discussed by a group of scholarly
advisers on February 7, 1994.##3  Most had suggestions for
improvement but almost everyone was basically laudatory. Dr.
Richard Hallion, the Air Force Historian, called it "a great
script." He joined with his military historian colleague Herman
Wolk in pronouncing it "a most impressive piece of work,
comprehensive and dramatic, obviously based upon a great deal of
sound research, primary and secondary," in need only of a "bit of
'tweaking'".
        </p>
        <p>
            The Air Force Association thought differently. During the
previous summer and fall, Harwit, with admirable if incautious
openness, had actively solicited the group's involvement. Though
he received a strongly negative response to a July 1993 concept
treatment, Harwit nevertheless sent along the January 1994 draft
script for review. The AFA, breaching confidentiality, leaked it
to media and veterans groups, accompanied by a slashing Correll
critique in the April 1994 issue of AIR FORCE Magazine -- a sneak
attack that set the terms and tone of the ensuing debate. (Air
Force Historian Hallion now also became a vigorous critic, the
"great script" of February becoming "an outright failure" by
April.)
        </p>
        <p>
             Over the following months inaccurate and malicious
accusations tumbled forth in a variety of forums.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Washington Times said Truman's reasoning for using the
bomb "was dismissed by the curators in favor of a theory that he
ordered the bomb dropped to impress Soviet leader Josef Stalin."
        </p>
        <p>
            The Wall Street Journal said scriptwriters "disdain any
belief that the decision to drop the bomb could have been
inspired by something other than racism or blood-lust." Picking
up on Correll's claim that kamikaze pilots were treated "with
near-mystical reverence," the Journal decried the "oozing
romanticism with which the Enola show's writers describe the
kamikaze pilots." The curators had supposedly called them
"youths, their bodies overflowing with life," a charge reporter
Ken Ringle repeated the next day in The Washington Post. But the
quoted text was in fact an excerpt from a pilot's journal,
included to give viewers "insight into [the kamikaze's] suicidal
fanaticism, which many Americans would otherwise find
incomprehensible."
        </p>
        <p>
            Washington Times columnist R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr. called the
museum staff a bunch of "politically correct pinheads." Had one
million Americans died invading Japan, Tyrrell added, "surely
that would have left some of the present pinheads . . .
fatherless or even, oh bliss, unborn."
        </p>
        <p>
            Lance Morrow, writing in Time, found the script "way left of
the mark." It managed to "portray the Japanese as more or less
innocent victims of American beastliness and lust for revenge."
"A revisionist travesty," the text "seemed an act of something
worse than ignorance; it had the ring of a perverse generational
upsidedownspeak and Oedipal lese majeste worthy of a fraud like
Oliver Stone."
        </p>
        <p>
            Increasingly, critics charged anti-Americanism. When Harwit
asked if veterans really suspected the National Air and Space
Museum was "an unpatriotic institution," Correll replied: "The
blunt answer is yes."
        </p>
        <p>
            The AFA editor began probing the Smithsonian staff's
backgrounds. Director Harwit had a suspicious resume. He had been
born in Czechoslovakia and raised in Istanbul, Correll noted,
before coming to the US in 1946. Harwit had, to be sure, joined
the U.S. Army in 1955-7, but he had been "influenced" by his work
on nuclear weapons tests at Eniwetok and Bikini. This experience
had led him to assert that "I think anybody who has ever seen a
hydrogen bomb go off at fairly close range knows that you don't
ever want to see that used on people."
        </p>
        <p>
            As for the curators, Correll pointed out that "none of them
[were] veterans of military service," that one (Tom Crouch)
planned a lecture at the "Japanese Cultural and Community Center
of Northern California," and that another (Michael Neufeld) was
of Canadian origin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ringle of The Washington Post observed that the said
Canadian had spent his undergraduate years at the University of
Calgary from 1970-4, "when Americans were fleeing to Canada to
escape the Vietnam War." Ringle contrasted Neufeld with an
elderly American POW, who during an interview came "close to
tears" wondering if the curator wasn't suggesting "that the
thousands of Japanese killed by those bombs were somehow worth
more than the thousands of American prisoners in Japan?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Pundits hammered at the curators' deficient patriotism. Jeff
Jacoby of the Boston Globe claimed the script was "anti-
American." Jonathan Yardley in The Washington Post called it as
"a philippic not merely against war but against the United
States," a piece of "anti-American propaganda."
        </p>
        <p>
            The American Legion, too, said the script inferred "that
America was somehow in the wrong and her loyal airmen somehow
criminal..." One disgruntled veteran, noting that the Japanese
"have bought most of Hawaii and lots of the US," added: "Lets
hope they have not bought the Smithsonian."
        </p>
        <p>
            Congressmen picked up the un-American refrain. Sam Johnson
(R-Texas), an Air Force fighter pilot for 27 years and a POW in
Vietnam for seven, denounced the scripts as "a blatant betrayal
of American history." Peter Blute (R-Massachusetts) fired off a
letter to Smithsonian Secretary Robert McCormick Adams, cosigned
by 23 colleagues, condemning the proposed exhibit as "biased" and
"anti-American."
        </p>
        <p>
            Unprepared for such a barrage, Smithsonian officials
scrambled to placate their opponents. Distancing himself somewhat
from his curators, Harwit told his staff that "a second reading
shows that we do have a lack of balance and that much of the
criticism that has been levied against us is understandable." He
called for revisions to accommodate legitimate concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Air & Space issued a second version on May 31 -- now renamed
"The Last Act: The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II" --
and then a third on August 31. Each expanded the treatment of
earlier Japanese aggression. Each cut out some of the objects and
language deemed objectionable. Each was greeted by demands for
further change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Congresspeople escalated their involvement. Senator Nancy
Kassebaum (R-Kansas) was already on record as insisting that "we
should not interpret the dropping of the bomb as we look at it
today," but rather "put it in the context of the time" (as if the
script hadn't run into trouble for doing precisely that). On
September 19 she introduced a "Sense of the Senate" resolution.
It declared that even with the latest changes the script was
"revisionist and offensive." The Senate enjoined the NASM to
avoid "impugning the memory of those who gave their lives for
freedom" (though even Correll had admitted it treated the
veterans "with respect.")
        </p>
        <p>
            Senator Slade Gorton (R-Washington) laid out even more
explicitly the kind of historical interpretation the government
might deem acceptable. He attached to the Interior Department's
appropriations bill a provision that Congress "expects" the Enola
Gay exhibit to "properly and respectfully recognize the
significant contribution to the early termination of World War II
and the saving of both American and Japanese lives."
        </p>
        <p>
            On September 21, the day Gorton's injunction was adopted,
Smithsonian officials sat down for their first marathon
negotiating session with the American Legion. The Institution had
turned to the nation's premiere veterans' group, using the good
offices of Smithsonian Undersecretary Constance Newman, thinking
perhaps that if it could be persuaded to sign off on a script,
further assaults might be forestalled.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a time the strategy seemed to be working. "This exhibit
is taking a more balanced direction," said a Legion spokesman.
"It's not a propaganda piece by any means." But to obtain this
support museum representatives had to submit to a line-by-line
script review -- "they drafted pages while we talked," boasted a
Legion spokesman -- and to accept extensive transformations. High
Smithsonian officials believed they were responding to valid
concerns raised by an important focus group, addressing issues of
style not substance, and grouping caveats (but not eliminating
them) in order to emphasize the main line. But the scripts that
emerged from this process -- a fourth on October 3, and a fifth
and final one on October 26 -- had been shorn of nuance and
controversy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last version evoked Japanese bushido ideals ("Die but
never surrender") to justify asserting that invasion "casualties
conceivably could have risen to as many as a million (including
up to a quarter of a million deaths)." This estimate, museum
spokesmen conceded, was not based on any new evidence but was an
"extrapolation" from Okinawa casualties. The treatment of
alternatives to invasion, debates over unconditional surrender,
questions about Nagasaki, the reservations of high ranking
military and civilian figures like Leahy, Eisenhower, and even
Truman himself -- all were now drastically reduced, or deleted
altogether. Further Ground Zero images and artifacts --
especially those depicting women, children and religious
objects -- were jettisoned; only a single picture of a corpse
remained. The last section dealing with nuclear proliferation was
scrapped.
        </p>
        <p>
            The exhibition, originally an effort to understand the Enola
Gay's mission, had become an effort to justify it. As the script
now summarized the story: "Japan, although weakened, was not
willing to surrender. The atomic bomb offered a way to change
that. A bloody invasion loomed if atomic bombs did not force
Japan to surrender. . . . For Truman, even the lowest of the
estimates was abhorrent. To prevent an invasion he feared would
become 'an Okinawa from one end of Japan to the other,' and to
try and save as many American lives as possible, Truman chose to
use the atomic bomb."
        </p>
        <p>
            The last words were given to six veterans who had written
NASM during the controversy. Four of the six letters cited
punctuated the script's thesis. "I honestly feel, wrote one,
"that millions of lives, both American and Japanese, were saved
by that one crew on that one airplane!" "Americans, in my
estimation, should make no apologies for strategic fire-bombing
or dropping the atomic bomb," said another. "It took that to win
the war!"
        </p>
        <p>
            So thoroughgoing and one-sided were the changes that they
amounted to a recantation. As the outgoing National Commander of
the Legion reported to his troops: "We went face to face with the
Smithsonian officials, and they blinked."
        </p>
        <p>
            Now it was the scholarly community's turn to protest. The
Organization of American Historians' Executive Committee wrote
the Smithsonian's Board of Regents on September 19 urging them
"to support the National Air and Space Museum staff." On October
22 it condemned "threats by members of Congress to penalize the
Smithsonian Institution." The OAH also deplored "the removal of
historical documents and revisions of interpretations of history
for reasons outside the professional procedures and criteria by
which museum exhibitions are created."
        </p>
        <p>
            On November 16, a group of 48 "historians and scholars"
charged a "transparent attempt at historical cleansing." They
protested the excision of documents, the removal of artifacts,
the whiting out of contemporary and historical debates, and the
alteration of interpretations in the absence of new evidence.
Though "we yield to no one in our desire to honor the American
soldiers who risked their lives during World War II to defeat
Japanese militarism," the historians said, the deletion of so
many "irrevocable facts" had reduced the exhibit "to mere
propaganda, thus becoming an affront to those who gave their
lives for freedom."
        </p>
        <p>
            Peace groups, too, objected. The Fellowship of
Reconciliation, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and Pax
Christi USA were among those declaring that pressure from
military and veterans groups had "compromised the integrity of
the exhibit." Activists met with NASM officials on December 15,
1994 to decry "political censorship." They demanded the exhibit
state that why the bomb was dropped and whether it had been
necessary to end the war "are matters of vigorous scholarly and
public debate on which Americans do legitimately disagree."
        </p>
        <p>
            Amid all this uproar, the organized museum community
remained noticeably silent.
        </p>
        <h2>Endgame</h2>
        <p>
            The focal point of these charges and countercharges was the
newly arrived Smithsonian Secretary, I. Michael Heyman.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before his official installation on September 19, 1994, the
former Chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley had
opposed AFA-inspired pressure on NASM. Writing in August for the
October issue of Smithsonian Magazine, the incoming Secretary
urged resisting those who "want the exhibition to be devoted
solely to the justifications for dropping the bomb (with
omissions of its effects)." Curators, he insisted, were educators
not propagandists.
        </p>
        <p>
            After his installation, Heyman tried to use the outcry from
the scholars and peace groups to carve out a middle ground
position. "The Institution is now being criticized from both ends
of the spectrum -- from those who consider the exhibition as a
'revisionist' product critical of the United States to those who
accuse us of staging an exhibition which glorifies the decision
of the United States to use atomic weapons. . . . This indicates
to me that we are probably squarely in the middle, which, as a
national institution, is not a bad place to be."
        </p>
        <p>
            But the Air Force Association wasn't interested in
compromise, it wanted unconditional surrender. The October 26th
revision, Correll admitted, had corrected many of "the worst
offenses," removed most "anti-American speculation," and attained
"parity" in casualty photos. No matter: it was not "an acceptable
salvage job". It continued to ask questions, "to doubt, probe,
and hint." "I don't think there should be doubts about whether
that policy [of unconditional surrender] is right," Correll
declared, in effect setting himself above most of the nation's
wartime leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was, he concluded, "no longer enough to clean up this
exhibition script." Now it was "imperative" that Smithsonian
officials go after the curators who had "produced such a biased,
unbalanced, anti-American script in the first place."
        </p>
        <p>
            The American Legion, however, remained a stumbling block.
In October, Director of Internal Affairs Hubert R. Dagley II had
rejected narrow views of the controversy that denounced the show
only as "an unflattering portrayal of one branch of the armed
forces" or "an indictment of strategic bombing". The Legion
expressed what it considered more high-minded concerns -- the
exhibit's "potential to undermine not only our people's faith in
their forefathers, but also their confidence in a revered and
respected American institution" -- the Smithsonian. Though it
rejected an outright endorsement, it also refrained from
condemning the script it had helped produce.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the Legion came under attack from media-inflamed
veterans for being "more 'liberal'" and "not as combative" as the
Air Force Association. By January, the group was backing away
from neutrality, claiming the fifth script hadn't gone far
enough, and hinting that without additional changes it would
shift over to opposition. Indeed, on January 4th, National
Commander William M. Detweiler made an in-house recommendation to
call for cancellation.
        </p>
        <p>Changes were forthcoming, but not ones the Legion was
looking for. In mid-November, a delegation of historians led by
Advisory Committee member Barton Bernstein had met with Harwit.
They presented him with documentary evidence falsifying the
October 26 draft's claim that, in the crucial meeting on June 18,
1945, Truman had been given an estimate of 250,000 casualties for
the invasion of Kyushu. They cited Admiral Leahy's diary entry,
written that evening, which stated that "General Marshall is of
the opinion that such an effort will not cost us in casualties
more than 63,000 of the 190,000 combatant troops."</p>
        <p>
            On January 9, 1995, Harwit -- his scholarly integrity on the
line -- proposed to the Legion a change in this volatile subject.
He submitted two pages of new label copy. They did not, as was
widely reported, accept 63,000 as an "official" figure; the
historians all agreed such numbers were speculative. But the new
text did drop the 250,000 figure, along with equally ungrounded
claims that American casualties "conceivably could have risen to
as many as a million (including up to a quarter of a million
deaths)." The revised text continued, however, to underscore
Truman's awareness that Japan had "some two million troops
defending the home islands"; his fear of "an Okinawa from one end
of Japan to the other"; the likelihood that many additional
Allied and Asian lives would have been lost; and the fact that
for Truman, "even the lowest of the casualty estimates was
unacceptable." It concluded, as before, that "to save as many
lives as possible, he chose to use the atomic bomb."
        </p>
        <p>
            This may have been more accurate but it made the Legion
leadership's already shaky position completely untenable. On
January 19th, seizing the opportunity Harwit had naively handed
them, they called for the show's cancellation. In a public letter
to President Clinton, they charged the Smithsonian with including
"highly debatable information which calls into question the
morality and motives of President Truman's decision to end World
War II quickly and decisively by using the atomic bomb."
        </p>
        <p>
            Five days later, on January 24th, 81 Congresspeople sent a
letter to Secretary Heyman demanding Harwit's ouster for his
"continuing defiance and disregard for needed improvements to the
exhibit."
        </p>
        <p>
            Opposition opinion now crystallized around a suggestion of
General Paul Tibbets, the man who had named the Enola Gay (after
his mother) and piloted it over Hiroshima. Early in the debate,
Tibbets, unhappy that many were "second-guessing the decision to
use the atomic weapons," had issued a soldierly injunction: "To
them, I would say, "Stop!"  The plane, Tibbets declared, needed
only an eleven word label: "'This airplane was the first one to
drop an atomic bomb.' You don't need any other explanation."
Tibbets wanted no questions, no controversies, no account of
bombs bursting in air.
        </p>
        <p>
            Facing special hearings in the House and Senate, threats to
the Smithsonian's budget (77% of which came from the federal
government), and a loss of confidence among corporate
contributors on whom he was counting to fund a planned 150th
Anniversary celebration in 1996, Secretary Heyman called it
quits. On January 30, 1995, adopting Tibbet's position, he
scrapped the exhibition in favor of "a display, permitting the
Enola Gay and its crew to speak for themselves."
        </p>
        <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
        <p>
            Heyman argued this was the wrong show in the wrong place at
the wrong time. The NASM had "made a basic error in attempting to
couple an historical treatment of the use of atomic weapons with
the 50th anniversary commemoration of the end of the war." The
veterans "were not looking for analysis," he said, "and, frankly,
we did not give enough thought to the intense feelings such an
analysis would evoke." The implication was that curators should
have waited a few years, or even a decade, until the old soldiers
had faded away.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a plausible position. Some veterans certainly saw Air &
Space more as shrine than museum. Aviator groups -- convinced the
Smithsonian had barred the B-29 out of embarrassment -- had been
fighting for years to get it restored and displayed, to validate
their wartime sacrifices. It was Harwit, ironically, who came to
their defense. Convinced they deserved a commemoration he pushed
to have the restoration ready for the 50th anniversary. Some vets
no doubt felt betrayed to learn the NASM intended to raise any
questions whatever about the plane's mission, even those asked by
their wartime commanding officers. As did Tibbets, they wanted
the Enola Gay presented pristinely, like the Spirit of St. Louis,
not juxtaposed with evidence of the damage it had wrought, even
if that damage was declared justifiable.

        <p>
            So perhaps it was foolhardy to make the attempt. Perhaps,
once the distress became apparent, the NASM should have folded
its hand immediately, avoiding the drawn-out and damaging saga
that followed. But there are problems with such a seemingly
politic perspective.

        <p>
            First, while historian Edward Linenthal is right to remark
that fiftieth anniversaries "intensify arguments over any form of
remembrance" because they "are the last time when you have
massive groups of veterans or survivors who are able to put their
imprint on the event," the mere passage of time does little to
dull the edge of controversy. Recall the brouhaha that exploded
over "The West as America" show -- a treatment of century-old
events -- and the impassioned debates that broke out over
Columbus' enterprise on the 500th anniversary of his first
voyage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Second, the postponement strategy is condescending to the
veterans. Many protestors were not acting out of "feelings" -- in
contrast to the museum's "analysis" -- but from a belief that the
show was advancing an analysis with which they disagreed. Many
were simply out to achieve the "balance" or "context" that the
mass media assured them was atrociously absent. If the Museum had
aggressively presented them with accurate information about the
first script -- and certainly the last one -- many might have
been won to the Smithsonian's side in support of a full-rigged
exhibition. Witness the posting on a WWII e-mail network from a
veteran and former exhibition critic: "I have reviewed the most
recent script (#5) and it is a considerable improvement over its
predecessors and in fact I am not unhappy about it."
        </p>
        <p>
            This raises, in turn, the third and largest problem. Heyman
has faulted his curators for paying insufficient attention to the
Smithsonian's "stakeholders." Apart from the fact that NASM
worked with veterans all along -- in the end so closely that they
may have abdicated their curatorial responsibilities -- the
comment suggests the Secretary hasn't sufficiently confronted the
dilemmas museums face these days.
        </p>
        <p>
            In recent years curators have reached out to communities
they wish to represent and address, seeking to involve them in
the process of exhibit production. Excellent in theory, this has
proved difficult in practice. In the case of immigrants, blacks,
workers, women, and Native Americans, it turns out to be no
simple matter to discover who exactly "the community" is. Or who
gets to speak for that community. Or what to do when some groups
contest the right of other groups to serve as spokespeople. Or
how to respond to claims that, e.g., only Latinos can/should
speak for Latinos. Or how to rebut a group that denies a museum's
right to say anything at all about it without prior approval. Or
what to do when an exhibit offers a variety of perspectives on a
controversial issue, only to be met with a dogmatic insistence
that only one of the perspectives is true, that the very notion
of debate is "relativistic" and illegitimate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The problems are no less complex when dealing with atomic
bombs. Why are WWII veterans the significant "stakeholders" here?
Are not the Second World War and the postwar proliferation of
nuclear arms issues of transcendent national importance, of
concern to all American citizens? If, as now seems likely, the
plane will be accompanied not only by Tibbet's eleven-word label,
but by Tibbets himself (via videotaped interview), is there not
something problematic about treating the aircraft as a mere aero-
artifact, like a kettle or a wedding dress, that requires only
some owner-provided information about its original usage? Is it
appropriate that the only commentary on the Enola Gay be issued
by the man who flew it?
        </p>
        <p>
            And even if veterans are the "relevant public," which
veterans are we talking about? There have been a variety of
military actors in this drama; the press and Smithsonian alike
too easily conflated them. There's no question that old soldiers
gave the anti-NASM protest its moral legitimacy and political
clout. But they were not the only combatants in this struggle.
Part of the NASM's problem, I think, is that it never quite
realized who and what it was up against.
